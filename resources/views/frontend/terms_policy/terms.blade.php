                        <p>Full payment is required in advance before hosting service is established. Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited sends out invoices that are due every pay period. You are given fifteen (5) days to fully pay the invoice.</p>
                        <p>You warrant and represent that the information you supply in the Order Form (or other information that Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited may require) is accurate and truthful. All payment-due notices will be sent by e-mail. No bills or invoices will be sent by postal mail or fax. If payment was not received by the due-date, your account will be suspended. It is the client&apos;s responsibility to ensure that payment is made to Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited prior to the renewal date and although Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited sends renewal notices to our customers prior to their renewal date, because of the ability for a customer to change their contact email addresses without notifying Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited, the customer is ultimately responsible for remembering their renewal date and to make sure payment is made upon the renewal. Failure to keep an account in good standing and/or service renewals paid for will result in service deactivation until the account and or service renewal is paid for in full.</p>

                        <p>It is the obligation of the Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited’ customers to know when their account comes up for renewal and, if their intention is to non-renew their account, they must fill out the Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited cancellation form 5 business days prior to their account&apos;s renewal date to ensure that the billing department can stop any renewal charges. Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited’ clients receive email notifications 10 days prior to the renewal date of their account, informing them that their renewal date is approaching. It is the customer&apos;s responsibility to ensure that Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited has a valid email address for which notices can be sent to Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited’ clients. If Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited does not receive a cancellation request prior to the customer&apos;s renewal, Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited will renew the clients&apos; account 24 hours prior to the renewal date, and will apply charges as appropriate. Accounts will be automatically renewed on the renewal date and be billed under the same fee structure as the plan that the client signed up for (unless plan changes were made or upgraded between the time when the client signed up & their renewal date). In the case of insufficient funds to charge such amount, you agree to allow Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited to place your account on a recurring payment plan, wherein we will collect a partial term quantity to avoid an interruption in service and to protect against accidental loss of intellectual property such as, but not limited to, website data, domain registration, etc. The 7-day money back guarantee applies only to the start date of the clients&apos; service with Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited, and does not apply to renewals of service.</p>

                        <p>Clients have the option to pay an invoice at any time by logging into their Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited account and submitting a payment. An invoice that is not paid by the due date is automatically marked overdue in the system. If an invoice is overdue by more than four days (the grace period), the account is automatically suspended and a 150,00 Ks late fee is added to the account. To reactivate an account that is suspended for failure to submit a payment within the grace period, a payment for the original invoiced amount plus 15,000 Ks must be submitted to Myanmar ICT Solutions Limited.</p>
